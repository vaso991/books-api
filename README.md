## Tech Stack
- [`Koa`](https://github.com/koajs/koa)
- [`koa-router`](https://github.com/ZijianHe/koa-router) for routing
- [`Zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for validation
- [`objection + knex`](https://github.com/vincit/objection.js) as database URM
- [`pino-http`](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http) for logging
- [`jest`](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [`supertest`](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest) for E2E testing
- [`esbuild`](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) as ts to js bundler.

## Authorization
- Authorization is implemented based on `Oauth` protocol. 
- On `/login` client receives `access_token` and `refresh_token`. 
- After `access_token` is expired, client must receive new `access_token` and `refresh_token`. 
`refresh_token` is stored in redis. 
- Client can `/revoke` `refresh_token`, after which, `refresh_token` is deleted from redis and client cannot receive new tokens using same `refresh_token`.
